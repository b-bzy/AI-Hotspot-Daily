## About
This project includes the boilerplate code for a GenLayer use case implementation, specifically a football bets game.

## What's included
- An example intelligent contract (Football Bets) with web access and LLM integration
- **Direct mode tests** — fast, in-memory unit tests with web/LLM mocking (~ms per test)
- **Integration tests** — full end-to-end tests against GenLayer Studio
- **Contract linting** — static analysis to catch common contract issues before deployment
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow for linting and direct tests
- A production-ready Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript, TanStack Query, and Radix UI
- Configuration file template and deployment scripts

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.12
- [GenLayer CLI](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-cli) globally installed: `npm install -g genlayer`
- GenLayer Studio (for integration tests and deployment): Install from [Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tooling-setup#using-the-genlayer-studio) or use the hosted [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Python environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Lint your contracts

Run the GenVM linter to catch issues before deployment:

```shell
genvm-lint check contracts/football_bets.py
```

The linter catches:
- Forbidden imports and non-deterministic calls
- Invalid storage types (must use `TreeMap`, `DynArray`, `u256`, etc.)
- Missing decorators and return type annotations
- Non-deterministic operations outside equivalence principle blocks
- And [20+ other rules](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genvm-linter)

### 3. Run direct mode tests

Direct mode tests run contracts in-memory without needing GenLayer Studio. They use mocks for web requests and LLM calls, giving you fast feedback (~milliseconds per test):

```shell
pytest tests/direct/ -v
```

Direct mode features used in these tests:
- `direct_deploy("contracts/file.py")` — deploy contract in memory
- `direct_vm.sender = address` — set transaction sender
- `direct_vm.mock_web(pattern, response)` — mock HTTP/render calls
- `direct_vm.mock_llm(pattern, response)` — mock LLM responses
- `direct_vm.expect_revert("message")` — assert expected failures
- `direct_vm.clear_mocks()` — reset mocks between calls

### 4. Deploy the contract

1. Choose your network: `genlayer network`
2. Deploy: `genlayer deploy` (runs the script in `/deploy/deployScript.ts`)

### 5. Run integration tests

Integration tests depl
